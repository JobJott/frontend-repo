For anyone confused how the dashboard is structured; heres a walkthrough, so the dashboard component is inside a major folder called "Dashboard" and inside this folder; There are 3 Subfolders(Pages, Sidedash and Styles) and 3 Main files(Dashboard, Mainboard and Sidedash)

## 3 Main Files

-1. Dashboard.jsx
-2. Mainboard.jsx
-3. SideDash.jsx

-1. Dashboard.jsx is the main file(entry point) for the dashboard components which houses the Sidedash and the mainboard components

-2. Sidedash.jsx is the side navigation dashboard; pretty much self explanatory

-3. Mainboard.jsx; houses the main structure of the dashboard pages routes, basically the entry point for mainboard components;(Overview, resume-builder, myapplication, contacts, support, account).jsx files

## 3 SubFolders

-1. Pages-(This is where you should put the codes for the mainboard(Overview, resume-builder, myapplication, contacts, support, account)) or subfolders
-2. Sidedash(contains the sidedash data and icons)
-3. Styles(contains the two main css file(Dashboard, Mainboard).css)
